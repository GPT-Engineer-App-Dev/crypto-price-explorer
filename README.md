Please implement the basic page structure for the Coinbase cryptocurrency prices interface described by the user. 

Include the following elements:
- A top navigation bar with a white background, containing:
  - The Coinbase logo on the left (use a placeholder image for now)
  - Menu items "Explore", "Learn", "Individuals", "Businesses", "Developers", and "Company"

- A main content area
- A footer area

Also add some basic styling:
